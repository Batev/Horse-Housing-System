## Horse-Housing-System (Wendy's Guesthouse)

**Program for renting horse houses.**

The program has a [Three-tier architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitier_architecture) consisting of a:
* Persistence Layer: Uses H2 database. The communication between the program and the database happens with prepared statements.
* Service Layer: Varifies data input and makes complicated computations.
* Presentation Layer: Uses JavaFX. Simple interface for the users.
_A simple sql create script could be found [here](https://github.com/Batev/Horse-Housing-System/blob/master/src/sepm/ss17/e1328036/util/Create.sql) for creating and filling the database._

_The assignment is part of the [Software Engineering und Projektmanagement](https://tiss.tuwien.ac.at/course/educationDetails.xhtml?dswid=2286&dsrid=450&semester=2017S&courseNr=188909) course at the Vienna University of Technology.
